# Chapter 1: Clean Code

## There will be code

Suggestion that we are close to the end of code - This book was released in 2008,
yet it mentions code generation - "Programmers won't be needed". This is more 
than relevant today with GenAI tools.

However, at the end of the day code specifies requirements. The level of abstraction
of languages will continue to increase but this does not mean code will be eliminated.
Even if code is generated, it needs a certain level and detail and understanding to
write a prompt to generate exactly what the specification wants.

A machine that will be able to create exactly what a customer wants will never
exist. Tools that help us format requirements into code will always exist and get
better - but they will never reach a point where they are able to generate code 
precisely based on requirements.

## Bad Code

Many businesses will rush to get their product out to market. The issue with this? Bugs, unmaintainable
code, that will inevitable lead to that product's (and maybe the company's) demise. 

We have all written bad code at some point in our lives. Again, the reason behind this is often
that we are in a rush. Taking time to think about the code we write - making it human-readable
will save time in the long run.
